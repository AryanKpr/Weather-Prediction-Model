Project Overview
The goal of this project is to:
- Analyze historical weather data
- Train a regression-based ML model
- Predict future weather metrics (temperature)
- Provide an easy-to-use web interface for predictions

The backend model is trained using scikit-learn, and the frontend is built using Streamlit.

Features
- 📊 Predicts temperature using historical weather parameters
